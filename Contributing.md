Usability, platform support and transparency are the core values of CSharpMath.

Usability
---------
New users should be able to figure out the API without looking at the Wiki.
Following good design patterns is one way to achieve this.

Platform support
----------------
As a contributor, you should have knowledge of news around the .NET community
and suggest new platforms with future potentials for CSharpMath to support.
Never get slowed down by dying platforms (e.g. Silverlight).

Transparency
------------
New issues and pull requests should be responded in a short time.
Use appropriate status labels when needed.
Avoid having stale open issues without status labels.
Always label resolutions to closed issues so future readers can know what happened.
