# CSharpMath
C# port of the wonderful iosMath LaTeX engine.

The layout portion of this is well underway. It seems to be producing sane results in a mocked environment. I've also ported most of the unit tests.
I've hardly touched the font/glyph portion, however.

I would LOVE to have collaborators. Just open an issue, or make a pull request.
